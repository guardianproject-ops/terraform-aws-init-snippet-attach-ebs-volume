# Short description of this project
description: |-

  This is a terraform module that creates an init snippet that will attach an
  EBS volume to the instance.  This snippet requires that the instance has an
  IAM instance profile which grants it the access needed to find and attach the
  EBS volume.

  There are other modules in the Guardian Project Ops Collection which can
  create EBS volumes with IAM profiles for each volume.

  Attaching the EBS  volume will loop until it succeeds.
